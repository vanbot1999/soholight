            <p>Architecture for kids CIC is a project that aims to bring joy and light to the streets of Soho during
                the festive season. The project features Christmas street lighting panels designed by local primary
                school pupils, inspired by the multicultural and multidisciplinary background of the project leader,
                Antonio Capelao.</p>

            <p>Your donation will help us cover the costs of materials, installation, maintenance, and storage of
                the lighting panels, as well as support the educational and artistic activities of the participating
                schools. By donating to this project, you will not only brighten up the city but also empower the
                young and creative minds of the future.</p>
